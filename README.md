# Hi there! I'm Addy 👋🏼

Let me begin with a quote that’s never failed to inspire me:

> “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you… Once you learn that, _you’ll never be the same again_.” — Steve Jobs

It’s a reminder that, despite how fixed the world can seem, it’s actually _malleable_ – something we can shape through curiosity, creativity and effort.

I love learning new tools, simplifying complexity and helping broaden people's views of what is possible. My happy place is wherever I can use my technical understanding and communication skills to connect, collaborate and create meaningful impact.

## A summary of my life so far

🏠 Born in Chennai, South India &rarr; immigrated to Sydney, Australia when I was six  
🎒 Attended four different primary schools in those early years and _learned to adapt quickly_ at a young age  
🧠 Finished Year 12 as a _Distinguished Achiever_, placing within the **top 2% statewide**  
🎓 Studied a **double degree in Engineering and Science** at the University of Sydney while working part-time as an academic tutor  
🥩 **Joined [Vow](https://www.eatvow.com)** – Australia's _first_ cultured meat company – as a scientist, helping develop and scale their bioprocess  
💪🏼 Inspired by friends at work, I trained for and **completed an [Ironman 70.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_BncS0iAvM&t=3h58m35s)**, with almost no prior experience in swimming, cycling or running  
🌏 After 3+ eventful years at Vow, I left to fulfil a dream of mine: **solo travel around the world**  
✅ 11 months later, I’d **visited 18 countries across 6 continents**, hitting my goal of seeing 30 before 30  
🚀 Currently, I’m spending my time learning [full stack web development](https://www.theodinproject.com), **exploring opportunities at the intersection of people and technology** and training for a full Ironman

## A few guiding principles I've been relying on
- Everything can be learned with time
- Seek out and do the things that scare you (it's where growth lies)
- Surround yourself with curious, kind and ambitious people
