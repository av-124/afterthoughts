# Hi there! I'm Addy :wave:

Let me begin with a quote that’s never failed to inspire me:

> “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were _no smarter than you_… Once you learn that, you’ll _never be the same again_.” — Steve Jobs

It’s a reminder that, despite how fixed the world can seem, it’s actually _malleable_ – something we can shape through curiosity, creativity and effort.

I’ve always been drawn to people and technology. I love learning new tools, exploring bold ideas and helping others make sense of them. My happy place is wherever I can use my knowledge and experience to connect, collaborate and create.

## A summary of my life so far

:house: Born in Chennai, South India &rarr; immigrated to Sydney, Australia when I was six  
:school_satchel: Attended four different primary schools in those early years and _learned to adapt quickly_ at a young age  
:brain: Finished Year 12 as a _Distinguished Achiever_, placing within the **top 2% statewide**  
:mortar_board: Studied a **double degree in Engineering and Science** at the University of Sydney while working part-time as an academic tutor  
:meat_on_bone: **Joined [Vow](https://www.eatvow.com)** – Australia's _first_ cultured meat company – as a scientist, helping develop and scale their bioprocess  
:muscle: Inspired by friends at work, I trained for and **completed an [Ironman 70.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_BncS0iAvM&t=3h58m35s)**, with almost no prior experience in swimming, cycling or running  
:earth_asia: After 3+ eventful years at Vow, I left to fulfil a long-term dream: to **travel around the world**  
:white_check_mark: 11 months later, I’d **visited 18 countries across 6 continents**, hitting my goal of seeing 30 before 30  
:rocket: Currently, I’m spending my time learning [full stack web development](https://www.theodinproject.com), training for a full Ironman and **exploring new opportunities** at the intersection of people and technology

## A few guiding principles I've been relying on
